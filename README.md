# Project II - Mission Space Launches

## Overview:

This project is a research endeavor focused on space mission launches that span from the inception of space exploration in 1958 through the year 2020. The primary objective is to comprehensively examine the history and evolution of space mission launches over this extensive period, encompassing both government and private-sector initiatives. Following this historical analysis, a deeper investigation is undertaken into the space agency with the most significant launch activity, NASA, with a particular focus on their budget for the year 2022 and the average success rate of their launches in that same year.

## Requirements/Libraries Used:

This code was written in Python/Jupyter Notebook, using the following libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn
- Re 
- Csv
- bs4 BeautifulSoup
- Requests

## Hypothesis

1. How many space mission launches achieved their primary objectives and can be classified as successful from 1958 to 2020?
2. What was the cumulative expenditure of space agencies worldwide on space missions from 1958 to 2020?
3. What was NASA's total budget allocation from 2018 to 2022?
4. What was NASA's average success rate for space missions in 2022, and how did it align with their budget expenditures in achieving mission success?

### 1. How many space mission launches achieved their primary objectives and can be classified as successful from 1958 to 2020?

This graphic tracks space launches worlwide from 1958 to 2020, revealing distinct periods: a surge in launches between 1960 and 1978, followed by consistent activity. After 2010, launches increased, while launch failures remained minimal, demonstrating a remarkable history of space exploration.

### 2. What was the cumulative expenditure of space agencies worldwide on space missions from 1958 to 2020?

As seeen in the figure below, the cumulative expenditures of the top 10 space agencies worldwide on space missions from 1958 to 2020. NASA stands as the unrivaled leader, significantly outpacing all other agencies in terms of financial commitment to space exploration. The prominent gap between NASA and the remaining agencies underscores its exceptional investment and contribution to space missions. This financial dominance reaffirms NASA's prominent role in shaping the global landscape of space exploration throughout the decades.

### 3. What was NASA's total budget allocation from 2018 to 2022?

Presented below as NASA's budget requests and authorized allocations for space missions from 2018 to 2022. Notably, NASA submitted budget requests that indicated a significant increment from 2019 to 2021. However, despite these budget increase proposals, the authorized budget remained relatively consistent throughout these years.

This discrepancy between the requested budget and the authorized budget highlights a recurring trend in NASA's financial planning for space missions. While NASA aspired to secure higher funding, the approved budgets often reflect a pattern of maintaining financial stability. This equilibrium in authorized allocations underscores the need for efficient resource management and the challenges in realizing significant budget increments for ambitious space endeavors.

### 4. What was NASA's average success rate for space missions in 2022, and how did it align with their budget expenditures in achieving mission success?

The data visualization below outlines provides an overview of NASA's mission success rates in 2022, offering insights into the outcomes of their space endeavors. Notably, NASA achieved a remarkable 95.7% success rate, signifying the proficient execution of their missions, as the overwhelming majority reached their intended objectives.

In addition, a 3.8% failure rate demonstrates NASA's commitment to transparency, acknowledging that some missions faced challenges and did not meet their predetermined goals.

Furthermore, the 0.5% partial failure rate reflects NASA's ability to address and mitigate issues during missions, ensuring that even when challenges arose, they made efforts to salvage a portion of the mission's objectives.

This graphic underscores NASA's dedication to achieving mission success while maintaining transparency about the occasional setbacks and partial failures encountered during the year 2022.

## In conclusion

* In the context of the graphic depicting space mission launches over several decades, the year 1969 stands out as an extraordinary moment in space exploration history. This was the year of the Apollo 11 mission, during which Neil Armstrong, on July 20, 1969, became the first person to walk on the moon. That's why we can see an increment of space mission launches between 1965 and 1970.

* NASA, established in 1958, has consistently maintained its position as one of the world's leading space agencies. Throughout its history, NASA has been at the forefront of space exploration, consistently ranking among the top space agencies with the highest number of launches. Its enduring commitment to missions, scientific discovery, and technological innovation has solidified its reputation as a pioneer in the field of space exploration. NASA's remarkable legacy in space missions cements its position as a key player in shaping the landscape of space exploration since its inception in 1958.

* NASA aspiration for higher funding often met the reality of maintaining financial stability. This equilibrium emphasizes the need for resource efficiency in space missions and the challenges inherent in securing substantial budget increases for ambitious endeavors. NASA's ability to adapt within these financial constraints speaks to its resilient dedication to space exploration.

* In 2022, NASA achieved a remarkable 95.7% success rate, a testament to their proficiency in executing missions. Their transparent acknowledgment of a 3.8% failure rate reflects their commitment to learning from challenges. Additionally, the 0.5% partial failure rate showcases their ability to salvage mission objectives, even when faced with setbacks. This graphic underscores NASA's dedication to mission success and their resilience in addressing mission challenges.
